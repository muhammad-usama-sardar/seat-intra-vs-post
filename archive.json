From the [use-cases], we align mostly with *3.2. Secure Provisioning*: automatic dissemination of configuration and secrets between mutually attesting TEEs. I'd like to share my experience and perspective on the debate around intra-handshake and post-handshake attestation.\n> \n> The basics of [aTLS] are similar to [early-attestation] with only ephemeral keys, but since we needed (wanted) to work with existing TLS software, the messages are conveyed over different (potentially unrelated) extension points. We originally opted for an intra-handshake protocol to keep the attestation and verification parts out of the application logic, and to leave cryptographic heavy-lifting to the TLS stack. If we had known about [exporters] back then, we might have chosen a different approach.\n> \n> I identified the following issues with our current implementation, which are partially reflected in [intra-vs-post]:\n> \n> 1. \"Keeping attestation out of the application logic\" is not as straightforward as it sounds. In the background-check model, the attester needs to collect evidence in response to the relying party's challenge (nonce). We were lucky that the Golang TLS stack can be supplied with arbitrary closures that are called during the handshake, but in my experience this is a rare design choice and may also be difficult to implement in other languages.\n> \n> 2. Conveying the evidence is not enough, it needs to be verified as well in order to end up with a trustworthy channel. We decided to integrate verification into the handshake, too, but that has massive drawbacks: Verification can take orders of magnitude longer than normal TLS handshakes, and usually involves remote calls, affecting all sorts of timeouts. However, doing the verification at the application level would require forwarding information from the handshake (e.g. nonce), at which point the application needs to be fully aware of the handshake protocol in order to verify it, breaking the intended layering.\n> \n> 3. There's only so much information in a TLS alert message, and it's definitely not enough to understand remote verification failures. While I understand this to be a deliberate design choice by TLS, I found this to be a hindrance for operating and debugging a large number of services in practice.\n> \n> 4. I don't think saving extra roundtrips is an appropriate design goal when attestation is required. Generating evidence alone takes much longer than normal network roundtrip times, not even speaking of verification.\n> \n> All of the above leads me to a strong preference for a post-handshake protocol. In addition, I have justified hopes that a post-handshake protocol would also have the following benefits:\n> \n> A. It's much easier to adopt an attestation protocol if it does not require TLS libraries to add support first! Established libraries are slow to change and may even be reluctant to implement all published extensions.\n> B. It should be possible to port the general shape of a post-handshake attested TLS protocol to other protocols that provide secure channels and session binding (Noise comes to mind).\n> C. (Formal) verification of a protocol and audit of its implementations might be much easier if it ran *on top of* TLS. Existing proofs and certifications would not need to be reevaluated.\n> \n> Thanks for the consideration!\n> \n> Cheers, Markus\n> \n> [use-cases]: https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-mihalcea-seat-use-cases-00.html\n> [intra-vs-post]: https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-usama-seat-intra-vs-post-00.html\n> [aTLS]: https://github.com/edgelesssys/contrast/blob/3bd17f8/docs/docs/architecture/attestation/atls.md\n> [early-attestation]: https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-fossati-seat-early-attestation-02.html\n> [exporters]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5705.html\n> [id-crisis]: https://github.com/CCC-Attestation/formal-spec-id-crisis\n\n",

We have been building an Attested TLS protocol for a web-based\napplication, and we had to do a post-handshake implementation.\nIntra-handshake requires too much change. For example, you have to\nreimplement or customize how Nginx (or other) servers speak TLS. This would\ntake months and more to have a standard implementation that is somehow safe\nto use. It's different in a post-handshake implementation where you can\nhave a full working example in a matter of weeks.\n\n[Archive link2](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/seat/8eynK9ky5F-TcnL_UPbSRDKuK1E/)\n\n> For what I said about post-handshake vs intra-handshake, I will try to\n> elaborate with a few points:\n> - TLS might not be well suited to include this in its protocol.

Constellation was using the same protocol, but the project is archived since 2026. Funnily enough, I just learned that our earlier SGX-based products did post-handshake attestation.\n> \n> I don't know whether our patterns justify a new use case, but since you asked: A Contrast system has three types of participants - User, Coordinator, Workload. The latter two types run in TEEs, with the following communication flows (numbered for reference, not for temporal ordering):\n> \n> 1. The user creates an aTLS channel to the Coordinator, and if it passes all checks the user configures it with root key material. The Coordinator creates an internal CA for workloads. Only the Coordinator attests. This happens infrequently.\n> 2. Workloads create aTLS channels to the Coordinator and send a CSR. If the Coordinator is satisfied with the workload's attestation, it signs a certificate for the workload. Together with the CA certificate, workloads can now communicate with standard mTLS using these certificates (no more attestation involved). This happens frequently (with Kubernetes pod starts/restarts). While the CSR could be signed without an attested TLS channel, it's easier for the workload to trust the response this way. Furthermore, some workloads also obtain a persistent secret seed over this channel, which they can use to derive durable key material themselves (e.g. volume decryption key).\n> 3. Coordinators contact other Coordinators to obtain the root key material for themselves. Both sides need to attest to ensure trustworthiness. This happens infrequently.\n> \n> I did a quick experiment in our testing lab, running on the same machine as the Coordinator:\n> \n> 1. TCP connections are local, and thus the TCP connection establishment unsurprisingly takes only 0.5ms. But even to neighbouring nodes in the same cluster, the TCP handshake takes below 2ms.\n> 2. I measured generation of evidence including the TLS session establishment, but with these numbers I don't think it makes a lot of difference:\n>    - SNP: Median time of 140ms from TCP SYN to TLS channel established and evidence sent to the client.\n>    - TDX: Median time of 1020ms, same procedure. I don't know why it is that slow, it should only be making machine-local remote calls, if any.\n> 3. So far, I only managed to measure TDX verification, which adds another 340ms. This is bound by remote HTTP requests, afaiu, and could be optimized with locally cached collateral, CRL, etc. I'd expect SNP to exhibit similar timing, because verification does similar remote calls.\n> \n> Cheers, Markus",

It seems unavoidable that many, near-term uses of attestation will rely on non-ephemeral server-side state that must remain confidential, and that cannot feasibly be handled client-side only.\n> \n> Confidential AI is an emerging workload class for confidential computing, with requirements that explicitly include durable and confidential state governance. It inherently depends on (1) hardware capable of running large models, which has no short-term path to being feasible on consumer devices, and (2) mechanisms to query, synchronize, and protect large volumes of contextual data, which are similarly impractical to manage entirely on the client.\n> \n> This line of thinking appears consistent with the draft\u2019s motivation for post-handshake attestation, as well as the observation that intra-handshake attestation cannot account for state changes over the lifetime of a system. What I am curious about is whether it would be useful to frame this more explicitly as a general systems constraint: namely, that once durable, confidential server-side state is involved, trust decisions and key management inevitably live above the transport layer, with TLS (and ATLS) primarily providing binding and freshness rather than being the locus of trust itself.\n> \n> I\u2019m wondering whether this framing would be helpful as future work, particularly when thinking about the relative prioritization of ATLS mechanisms versus application-level attestation solutions for stateful services.\n\nNeed to clarify terms: \n\n- non-ephemeral server-side state\n- durable, confidential server-side state\n- stateful services\n- durable and confidential state governance\n",

For each of these, when I say \"state\" I am referring specifically to the application-level data that must remain confidential to run a \"confidential ai\" service, the three primary classes being:\n> \n> 1. Contextual data used at inference time. This could be prompts, retrieved documents, conversation history, tool state, etc. This data is large and evolves over time.\n> 2. Customer managed cryptographic material for encryption and identity. These are long-lived and user recoverable and should only ever be accessible in the client or in the tee. Possibly this could be service-managed as well.\n> 3. Trained model weights or parameters\n> \n> Though I was primarily thinking of 1) and 2) for the majority of confidential ai use cases.\n> \n> By \"non-ephemeral\" or \"durable\" server side state, I mean state that persists across TLS connections and sessions, evolves over time, and cannot be practically managed solely on the client. Outside of confidential AI, one could argue most cases could be handled via more classic end to end encryption, where data is only ever plaintext on the client. In such cases, ATLS can add useful guarantees about binding server behavior to an attested execution environment.\n> \n> In contrast, for confidential AI, the classes of data in (1) and (3) are often not feasible to exist only on the client. As a result, they are pushed to server-side execution environments that are capable of both running data- and compute-intensive workloads and producing attestation evidence. My intended point was that, for such provider-specific confidential AI services, the platform operator will likely need to present application-level attestation to users, so that claims about how these classes of data are handled can be evaluated and enforced.\n> \n> As an example, a browser-side SDK or client is effectively constrained to application-layer attestation. In a web-based interaction model, which is likely a primary way many users will interact with confidential AI, client-side decisions (e.g., whether it is safe to send sensitive data to the service) must generally be made at the application level, since the TLS stack is not extensible or observable from browser code.",
