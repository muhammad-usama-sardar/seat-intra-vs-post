1.  Introduction

   Based on our extensive analysis of attested TLS [Tech-Concepts], we
   classify attested TLS into three main categories:

   *  pre-handshake attestation,

   *  intra-handshake attestation, and

   *  post-handshake attestation.

   In pre-handshake attestation, the signing of Claims [Tech-Concepts]
   precedes the TLS handshake, while post-handshake attestation applies
   the reverse.  Intra-handshake attestation requires the signing of
   Claims to be done within the TLS handshake protocol.

1.1.  Scope

   In this version, we analyze the three categories (without
   combinations) with a focus on the last two.

   The current scope of this draft is existing specifications and real-
   world implementations pointed in the given references.  Any
   theoretical solutions are currently out of scope until some
   specification or implementation emerges.

   For simplicity, we consider simple Attester with only one Attesting
   Environment and only one Target Environment [RFC9334].  That is,
   complicated scenarios such as Composite Device [RFC9334] etc. are out
   of scope in this version.

   From RATS perspective, we consider Background Check Model [RFC9334].
   Future versions will add Passport Model [RFC9334].

1.2.  Note

   Regarding remote attestation, we note that:

   |  Remote attestation provides guarantees about the state of Attester
   |  *only* at the time at which signing of Claims is done to generate
   |  Evidence [Tech-Concepts].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   We use terminology from [RFC9334] and [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis]
   slightly loosely (intentionally) for readability.  Future versions
   will tighten it.

   In addition, we define three temporal terms:

   *  *Evidence Generation Time*: Time when Evidence is generated (more
      specifically when Claims are signed)

   *  *Connection Establishment Time*: Time at which TLS handshake is
      performed

   *  *Lifetime of Connection*: Time period starting from Evidence
      Generation Time until the connection exists.

3.  Pre-handshake Attestation

   Since the Evidence Generation Time could be at any arbitrary point of
   time in the past compared to the connection establishment time, pre-
   handshake attestation provides no guarantees about the state of
   Attester at the Evidence Generation Time and during the Lifetime of
   Connection.

4.  Intra-handshake Attestation

   Intra-handshake attestation improves the situation where Evidence
   Generation Time is the same as Connection Establishment Time.

   In following subsections, we present the benefits and limitations of
   intra-handshake attestation.

4.1.  Benefits

4.1.1.  No Additional Application-Level Protocol

   Intra-handshake attestation does not require a new application-layer
   protocol or message exchange.  Evidence and related metadata are
   conveyed within handshake via TLS extensions.  TLS is responsible for
   conveyance of the Evidence; it does not perform appraisal of Evidence
   or authorization.  Appraisal of Evidence, policy evaluation, and
   trust decisions are performed by application-level components that
   consume the attestation properties exposed by the TLS stack.  As a
   result, while no new application-layer protocol is required,
   applications do incorporate additional trust logic to interpret
   attested connection properties and make security-relevant decisions.

4.1.2.  Avoids Extra Round Trips for One-time Attestation

   It avoids extra round trips for use cases which require remote
   attestation only once during Connection Establishment Time.

4.2.  Limitations

4.2.1.  Limited Claims Availability

   Since limited Claims are available at the Evidence Generation Time,
   it does not provide complete security posture of the Attester, such
   as runtime integrity of Attester.

4.2.2.  Invasive Changes in TLS

   To be made secure, it requires invasive changes in TLS protocol, as
   deep as key schedule and adding or modifying existing handshake
   messages [ID-Crisis].

4.2.3.  State After Connection Establishment Not Covered

   It provides no guarantees about the state of Attester during the
   lifetime of connection.  This is a security concern in long-lived
   connections where state of Attester may change after Connection
   Establishment Time.  Note that session resumption is a new connection
   [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis].

4.2.4.  High Handshake Latency

   Because of signature in Evidence generation and verification of
   signatures during appraisal, this leads to high handshake latency.
   This may not be desirable for some applications.

5.  Post-handshake Attestation

   Post-handshake attestation improves the situation further by signing
   the Claims during Lifetime of Connection, i.e., at the time when it
   is actually required.  Hence, together with use cases requiring one-
   time attestation, it covers the use cases of long-lived connections
   requiring re-attestation.  For post-handshake attestation, first
   round of remote attestation MUST be done immediately after Connection
   Establishment Time, and Relying Party (RP) [RFC9334] MUST not send
   any secure data until Evidence is successfully appraised.

   In following subsections, we present the benefits and limitations of
   post-handshake attestation.

5.1.  Benefits

   In general, it allows re-authentication and re-attestation without
   tearing down the connection.

5.1.1.  Full Claims Availability

   Since all Claims are available at the time of post-handshake
   attestation (during Lifetime of Connection), it provides complete
   security posture of the Attester.

5.1.2.  No Change in TLS

   It does not require any change in TLS protocol.

5.1.3.  State After Connection Establishment Is Covered

   It provides guarantees about the state of Attester during the
   Lifetime of Connection.  This is particularly helpful in long-lived
   connections where state of Attester may change after Connection
   Establishment Time.

5.1.4.  Standard Handshake Latency

   Since the signature in Evidence generation and verification of
   signatures during appraisal happen after Connection Establishment
   Time, there is no additional latency.

5.1.5.  Avoids Extra Round Trips

   Except for first round of remote attestation, post-handshake
   attestation outperforms the intra-handshake attestation (one round
   trip), which requires re-establishing the connection (1.5 round
   trip).

5.2.  Limitations

5.2.1.  Impact on Application Layer

   Post-handshake attestation may require changes at the application
   layer.  However, changes at the application layer do not necessarily
   imply modifications to application business logic or data exchange
   protocols.  Attestation-related functionality may be realized via
   application-level signalling (Exported Authenticators [RFC9261]) and
   trust logic, which may be implemented in intermediary components
   (e.g., proxies, sidecars, or middleware) on both client and server
   sides.  These components are responsible for exchanging and
   appraising attestation evidence and enforcing trust or authorization
   decisions before application data is processed.  This is analogous to
   common production deployments in which TLS termination and
   certificate handling are performed by a fronting proxy, while the
   application itself remains unchanged and resides behind it.

6.  Need for Post-handshake Attestation

   We argue that post-handshake attestation is unavoidable (e.g., re-
   attestation to track changes after Connection Establishment Time for
   long-lived connections).  Use cases where pre-handshake attestation
   and intra-handshake attestation are insufficient include AI agents/
   agentic AI [I-D.jiang-seat-dynamic-attestation].

   Intra-handshake attestation only adds unnecessary complexity which is
   avoidable.  All use cases of intra-handshake attestation can be
   covered by post-handshake attestation (by doing attestation round
   immediately after Connection Establishment Time) but not the other
   way around.

6.1.  IoT Constraints

   [SEAT-Charter] includes TLS client as RATS Attester.  Client could be
   a low-power IoT device.  There are use cases where periodic or on-
   demand attestation is required, such as periodic attestation for
   long-lived, low-power IoT devices or in IoT swarms that need to
   synchronize software versions before coordinated operations or after
   configuration updates.

   Moreover, we note some observations from LAKE WG:

   Michael Richardson shares his insight [MCR-LAKE]:

   |  I have a half-written document on putting EAT into the full BRSKI
   |  protocol.  A reason that I stopped is that I realized that doing
   |  security posture evaluation at onboarding time (only) wasn't
   |  enough.  It has to be done regularly.  So having a protocol used
   |  at onboarding time and another one during normal operation meant
   |  that the onboarding one would have bugs that never get fixed,
   |  since the code only runs once.

   Göran Selander observes [Goran-LAKE]:

   |  Indeed, if the authentication procedure is repeated at a later
   |  stage, for whatever reason, e.g. key rotation, it should be
   |  possible to repeat the attestation procedure.

7.  Existing Implementations

7.1.  Intra-handshake Attestation

   Prominent implementations of intra-handshake attestation are all
   vulnerable to relay attacks [RelayAttacks].  Some of them are abusing
   the extensions of TLS, such as SNI and ALPN, for conveyance of
   attestation nonce [RelayAttacks].

7.2.  Post-handshake Attestation

   Google [Keith-STET-CCC], Microsoft [Stunes-vTPM-CCC], and SCONE
   [SoK-Attestation] are all using post-handshake attestation.

8.  Security Considerations

   Most of the document is about security considerations.  Also,
   Security Considerations of [RFC9334] and [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis]
   apply.  In addition:

   *  Pre-handshake attestation is vulnerable to *replay* [RA-TLS] and
      *diversion* [ID-Crisis] attacks.

   *  Without significant changes to the TLS protocol: Intra-handshake
      attestation is vulnerable to *diversion* attacks [ID-Crisis].  It
      also does not bind the Evidence to the application traffic
      secrets, resulting in *relay* attacks [RelayAttacks].

   *  No attacks on post-handshake attestation are currently known.
      Post-handshake attestation avoids replay attacks by using fresh
      attestation nonce.  Moreover, it avoids diversion and relay
      attacks by binding the Evidence to the underlying TLS connection,
      such as using Exported Keying Material (EKM)
      [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis].  [RFC9261] and [RFC9266] provides
      mechanisms for such bindings.

8.1.  Exploit of Sensitive Hardware-level Information

   From the view of the TLS server, post-handshake attestation offers
   better security than intra-handshake attestation when the server acts
   as the Attester.  In intra-handshake attestation, due to the inherent
   asymmetry of the TLS protocol, a malicious TLS client could
   potentially retrieve sensitive hardware-level information from the
   Evidence *without the client's trustworthiness (i.e., authentication)
   first being established by the server*. This information (e.g.,
   vulnerable firmware version) can be exploited for attacks.  In post-
   handshake attestation, the server can ask for client authentication
   and only send the Evidence after successful client authentication.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
