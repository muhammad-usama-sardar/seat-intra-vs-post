1.  Introduction

   Based on our extensive analysis of attested TLS [Tech-Concepts], we
   classify attested TLS into three main categories:

   *  pre-handshake attestation,

   *  intra-handshake attestation, and

   *  post-handshake attestation.

   In pre-handshake attestation, the signing of Claims [Tech-Concepts]
   precedes the TLS handshake, while post-handshake attestation applies
   the reverse.  Intra-handshake attestation requires the signing of
   Claims to be done within the TLS handshake protocol.

1.1.  Scope

   In this version, we analyze the three categories (without
   combinations) with a focus on the last two, i.e., intra-handshake
   attestation and post-handshake attestation.

   The current scope of this draft is existing specifications and real-
   world implementations pointed in the given references.  Any
   theoretical solutions are currently out of scope until some
   specification or implementation emerges.

   For simplicity, we consider simple Attester with only one Attesting
   Environment and only one Target Environment [RFC9334].  That is,
   complicated scenarios such as Composite Device [RFC9334] etc. are out
   of scope in this version.

   From RATS perspective, we consider Background Check Model [RFC9334].
   Future versions will add Passport Model [RFC9334].

   From TLS perspective, the scope is limited to TLS 1.3 as per
   [SEAT-Charter].  That is, older versions of TLS are explicitly out of
   scope.

1.2.  Note

   Regarding remote attestation, we note that:

   |  Remote attestation provides guarantees about the state of Attester
   |  *only* at the time at which signing of Claims is done to generate
   |  Evidence [Tech-Concepts].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   We use terminology from [RFC9334] and [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis]
   slightly loosely (intentionally) for readability.  Future versions
   will tighten it.

   In addition, we define three temporal terms:

   *  *Evidence Generation Time*: Time when Evidence is generated (more
      specifically when Claims are signed)

   *  *Connection Establishment Time*: Time at which TLS handshake is
      performed

   *  *Lifetime of Connection*: Time period starting from Connection
      Establishment Time until the connection exists.

3.  Pre-handshake Attestation

3.1.  Benefits

   In certain deployments, there may be benefits for pre-handshake
   attestation.  As Yaroslav Rosomakho (as individual contributor)
   observes [Yaroslav-22Jan]:

   |  no modification of TLS, no changes to application protocols, and
   |  potential caching/scalability.

   Yaroslav Rosomakho (as individual contributor) further explains
   [Yaroslav-22Jan]:

   |  Many signed artifacts carry issuance time and validity constraints
   |  (e.g., JWT iat/exp [RFC7519], HTTP Message Signatures created/
   |  expires [RFC9421], SAML conditions [SAML]).  A timestamp alone is
   |  not the same as freshness, but a short validity window plus a
   |  trustworthy time source can be an acceptable assurance mechanism
   |  in some deployments.  Likewise, some schemes can provide stronger
   |  freshness via verifier-chosen challenges or monotonic counters.

3.2.  Limitations

   There are also security concerns on pre-handshake attestation for use
   cases such as confidential computing Section 8.  Since the Evidence
   Generation Time could be at any arbitrary point of time in the past
   compared to the Connection Establishment Time in the case of
   untrusted clocks as in confidential computing, pre-handshake
   attestation provides no guarantees about the state of Attester at the
   Connection Establishment Time and during the Lifetime of Connection.

4.  Intra-handshake Attestation

   In general, intra-handshake attestation improves the situation where
   Evidence Generation Time is the same as Connection Establishment
   Time, assuming freshness mechanisms, such as unpredictable, single-
   use challenge and clear replay handling, are in place.

   In following subsections, we present the benefits and limitations of
   intra-handshake attestation.

4.1.  Benefits

4.1.1.  No Additional Application-Level Protocol

   Intra-handshake attestation does not require a new application-layer
   protocol or message exchange.  Evidence and related metadata are
   conveyed within handshake via TLS extensions.  TLS is responsible for
   conveyance of the Evidence; it does not perform appraisal of Evidence
   or authorization.  Appraisal of Evidence, policy evaluation, and
   trust decisions are performed by application-level components that
   consume the attestation properties exposed by the TLS stack.  As a
   result, while no new application-layer protocol is required,
   applications do incorporate additional trust logic to interpret
   attested connection properties and make security-relevant decisions.

   Related to this, Markus Rudy shares his practical experience
   [Markus-16Jan]:

   |  Conveying the evidence is not enough, it needs to be verified as
   |  well in order to end up with a trustworthy channel.  We decided to
   |  integrate verification into the handshake, too, but that has
   |  massive drawbacks: Verification can take orders of magnitude
   |  longer than normal TLS handshakes, and usually involves remote
   |  calls, affecting all sorts of timeouts.  However, doing the
   |  verification at the application level would require forwarding
   |  information from the handshake (e.g. nonce), at which point the
   |  application needs to be fully aware of the handshake protocol in
   |  order to verify it, breaking the intended layering.

4.1.2.  Avoid Extra Round Trips for One-time Attestation

   It is claimed that intra-handshake attestation avoids extra round
   trips for use cases which require remote attestation only once during
   Connection Establishment Time.

   However, this may only be valid in cases when the Connection
   Establishment Time without remote attestation is significantly higher
   than the time for generation and appraisal of Evidence, such as
   cross-continent.  For instance, Markus Rudy shares his practical
   experience [Markus-16Jan]:

   |  I don't think saving extra roundtrips is an appropriate design
   |  goal when attestation is required.  Generating evidence alone
   |  takes much longer than normal network roundtrip times, not even
   |  speaking of verification.

   On request, he kindly conducted an experiment and shared his
   preliminary results of experiment based on attested TLS
   implementation in Edgeless Systems Contrast where Coordinator is one
   of the components [Markus-19Jan]:

   |  I did a quick experiment in our testing lab, running on the same
   |  machine as the Coordinator:

   |  *  TCP connections are local, and thus the TCP connection
   |     establishment unsurprisingly takes only 0.5ms.  But even to
   |     neighbouring nodes in the same cluster, the TCP handshake takes
   |     below 2ms.

   |  *  I measured generation of evidence including the TLS session
   |     establishment, but with these numbers I don't think it makes a
   |     lot of difference:

   |     -  SNP: Median time of 140ms from TCP SYN to TLS channel
   |        established and evidence sent to the client.

   |     -  TDX: Median time of 1020ms, same procedure.  I don't know
   |        why it is that slow, it should only be making machine-local
   |        remote calls, if any.

   |  *  So far, I only managed to measure TDX verification, which adds
   |     another 340ms.  This is bound by remote HTTP requests, afaiu,
   |     and could be optimized with locally cached collateral, CRL,
   |     etc.  I'd expect SNP to exhibit similar timing, because
   |     verification does similar remote calls.

   |  AMD is probably quicker because they're trading off with the
   |  appraisal time: the AMD report is not self-contained and can be
   |  generated with only the VM and the SP, but for verification you
   |  need to fetch the VCEK from somewhere, whereas the Intel quote
   |  includes the PCK cert and possibly other things that need to be
   |  fetched from a host service, if not the internet.

   We summarize that in the following table:

     +==============================+===========+====================+
     | Property                     | Intel TDX | AMD SEV-SNP        |
     +==============================+===========+====================+
     | Generation of Evidence + TLS | 1020      | 140                |
     +------------------------------+-----------+--------------------+
     | Appraisal of Evidence        | 340       | not available      |
     |                              |           | (expected ca. 340) |
     +------------------------------+-----------+--------------------+

      Table 1: Preliminary analysis by Markus Rudy (Median time in ms)

   As Yaroslav Rosomakho (as individual contributor) observes
   [Yaroslav-22Jan]:

   |  The argument that avoiding an extra RTT is not a relevant goal may
   |  depend heavily on deployment topology (LAN vs same-region vs
   |  cross-continent).

4.1.2.1.  Request for Contributions

   We invite the WG to submit their analysis results for cases such as:

   *  within continent

   *  across continent

4.2.  Limitations

4.2.1.  Limited Claims Availability

   Since limited Claims are available at the Evidence Generation Time,
   it does not provide complete security posture of the Attester, such
   as runtime integrity of Attester.  Examples include dynamic Claims,
   such as weights of trained model and contextual data in the case of
   AI agents/agentic AI [I-D.jiang-seat-dynamic-attestation],
   [Edward-20Jan], [I-D.aylward-aiga-1].  These dynamic Claims are
   neither available for pre-handshake attestation nor for intra-
   handshake attestation.

4.2.2.  Invasive Changes in TLS

   To be made secure, it requires invasive changes in TLS protocol, as
   deep as key schedule and adding or modifying existing handshake
   messages [ID-Crisis], which are explicitly out of scope of
   [SEAT-Charter]:

   |  The attested (D)TLS protocol extension will not modify the (D)TLS
   |  protocol itself.  It may define (D)TLS extensions to support its
   |  goals but will not modify, add, or remove any existing protocol
   |  messages or modify the key schedule.

   A detailed analysis of different binding mechanisms for intra-
   handshake attestation has been shared with the WG [RelayAttacks].

4.2.3.  State After Connection Establishment Not Covered

   It provides no guarantees about the state of Attester during the
   Lifetime of Connection.  This is a security concern in long-lived
   connections where state of Attester (at workload or platform level)
   may change after Connection Establishment Time.  Examples include AI
   agents/agentic AI [I-D.jiang-seat-dynamic-attestation],
   [Edward-20Jan], [I-D.aylward-aiga-1].  Note that session resumption
   is a new connection [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis].

4.2.4.  High Handshake Latency

   Because of signature in Evidence generation and verification of
   signatures during appraisal, this leads to high handshake latency.
   This may not be desirable for some applications.

   Markus Rudy shares his practical experience [Markus-16Jan]:

   |  Conveying the evidence is not enough, it needs to be verified as
   |  well in order to end up with a trustworthy channel.  We decided to
   |  integrate verification into the handshake, too, but that has
   |  massive drawbacks: Verification can take orders of magnitude
   |  longer than normal TLS handshakes, and usually involves remote
   |  calls, affecting all sorts of timeouts.  However, doing the
   |  verification at the application level would require forwarding
   |  information from the handshake (e.g. nonce), at which point the
   |  application needs to be fully aware of the handshake protocol in
   |  order to verify it, breaking the intended layering.

   As Yaroslav Rosomakho (as individual contributor) observes
   [Yaroslav-22Jan], note that Post-Quantum (PQ) transition may change
   the baseline.

4.2.5.  Maturity of TEEs

   With several attacks (see Section 8), attestation in TEEs may not yet
   be mature enough to be integrated _within_ TLS handshake.

   Ayoub Benaissa remarks [Ayoub-16Jan]:

   |  TLS might not be well suited to include this in its protocol.  Not
   |  sure TEEs are even as mature for the people to see that it should
   |  be included right now.  The plan to make it a post-handshake
   |  protocol makes more sense right now.  A future where it's
   |  incorporated into TLS might exist, but I don't think there is
   |  enough motivation right now.

4.2.6.  Amount of Effort

   Markus Rudy shares his practical experience [Markus-16Jan]:

   |  "Keeping attestation out of the application logic" is not as
   |  straightforward as it sounds.  In the background-check model, the
   |  attester needs to collect evidence in response to the relying
   |  party's challenge (nonce).  We were lucky that the Golang TLS
   |  stack can be supplied with arbitrary closures that are called
   |  during the handshake, but in my experience this is a rare design
   |  choice and may also be difficult to implement in other languages.

   Ayoub Benaissa remarks [Ayoub-16Jan]:

   |  An intra-handshake requires much more work compared to a post-
   |  handshake.  People need to agree on how to add this as optional in
   |  TLS (we can't force everyone to use it of course), the standard
   |  needs to be implemented by major libraries, and then it will be
   |  available in major client/server applications.  If any of the
   |  prior steps doesn't go through, it means you have to patch your
   |  components to make it work, which is not convenient / less secure.

4.2.7.  Difficulty of Debugging Attestation

   Markus Rudy shares his practical experience [Markus-16Jan]:

   |  There's only so much information in a TLS alert message, and it's
   |  definitely not enough to understand remote verification failures.
   |  While I understand this to be a deliberate design choice by TLS, I
   |  found this to be a hindrance for operating and debugging a large
   |  number of services in practice.

5.  Post-handshake Attestation

   Post-handshake attestation improves the situation further by signing
   the Claims during Lifetime of Connection, i.e., at the time when it
   is actually required.  Hence, together with use cases requiring one-
   time attestation, it covers the use cases of long-lived connections
   requiring re-attestation.  For post-handshake attestation, first
   round of remote attestation MUST be done immediately after Connection
   Establishment Time, and Relying Party (RP) [RFC9334] MUST not send
   any secure data until Evidence is successfully appraised.

   As Yaroslav Rosomakho (as individual contributor) proposes
   [Yaroslav-22Jan]:

   |  an explicit shim or gating layer that performs attestation after
   |  the TLS handshake completes but before any application data is
   |  exchanged.  This is operationally distinct from both intra-
   |  handshake attestation and fully application-integrated post-
   |  handshake attestation.  Such an approach could preserve standard
   |  TLS handshake behaviour and latency characteristics, avoid
   |  invasive TLS changes, and still prevent application data from
   |  flowing until attestation succeeds.  It may also mitigate some of
   |  the application-layer complexity by localizing attestation
   |  handling to a well-defined enforcement point (e.g., a sidecar or
   |  connection gate) rather than requiring per-protocol integration.

   So a promising idea is to have an attested TLS library as a layer in
   between TLS implementation and application layer.

   TLS (any implmentation) -> Attested TLS library -> Application Layer

   In following subsections, we present the benefits and limitations of
   post-handshake attestation.

5.1.  Benefits

   In general, it allows re-authentication and re-attestation without
   tearing down the connection.

5.1.1.  Full Claims Availability

   Since all Claims are available at the time of post-handshake
   attestation (during Lifetime of Connection), it provides complete
   security posture of the Attester.

5.1.2.  No Change in TLS

   It does not require any change in TLS protocol.

5.1.3.  State After Connection Establishment Is Covered

   It provides guarantees about the state of Attester during the
   Lifetime of Connection.  This is particularly helpful in long-lived
   connections where state of Attester may change after Connection
   Establishment Time.

5.1.4.  Standard Handshake Latency

   Since the signature in Evidence generation and verification of
   signatures during appraisal happen after Connection Establishment
   Time, there is no additional latency.

   Yaroslav Rosomakho (as individual contributor) shares his concern
   [Yaroslav-22Jan]:

   |  I don't think that moving latency related to attestation into
   |  after handshake is always a good thing.  In some real-time and
   |  streaming applications, a spike after the session is established
   |  may be much more disruptive than paying a cost during the
   |  handshake.

   We believe this can be resolved by the layering described in
   Section 5.

5.1.5.  Avoid Extra Round Trips

   Except for first round of remote attestation, post-handshake
   attestation outperforms the intra-handshake attestation (one round
   trip), which requires re-establishing the connection (1.5 round
   trip).

5.1.6.  Ease of Implementation

   Ayoub Benaissa remarks [Ayoub-16Jan]:

   |  We already implemented a post-handshake protocol and have a full
   |  demo working.  We were able to do this in a matter of weeks.
   |  That's because you don't need to modify any TLS implementation,
   |  but only add a few verification steps after the usual TLS
   |  handshake.  This is almost the same on the client and server side.

   Production-grade deployments, including Google STET [Keith-STET-CCC]
   and SCONE [SoK-Attestation], exist.

5.1.7.  Ease of Verification and Audit

   Post-handshake attestation has relatively easier formal analysis and
   verification.  The same may apply to audit.

   Markus Rudy remarks [Markus-16Jan]:

   |  (Formal) verification of a protocol and audit of its
   |  implementations might be much easier if it ran on top of TLS.
   |  Existing proofs and certifications would not need to be
   |  reevaluated.

5.1.8.  General Solution for Other Protocols

   In post-handshake attestation, design, verification and audit effort
   will be one-time and any protocol (e.g., Noise) which has support for
   exporters can then use it without changing each and every protocol.

   Markus Rudy shares this requirement [Markus-16Jan]:

   |  It should be possible to port the general shape of a post-
   |  handshake attested TLS protocol to other protocols that provide
   |  secure channels and session binding (Noise comes to mind).

5.2.  Limitations

5.2.1.  Impact on Application Layer

   Post-handshake attestation may require changes at the application
   layer.  However, changes at the application layer do not necessarily
   imply modifications to application business logic or data exchange
   protocols.  Attestation-related functionality may be realized via
   application-level signalling (Exported Authenticators [RFC9261]) and
   trust logic, which may be implemented in intermediary components
   (e.g., proxies, sidecars, or middleware) on both client and server
   sides.  These components are responsible for exchanging and
   appraising attestation evidence and enforcing trust or authorization
   decisions before application data is processed.  This is analogous to
   common production deployments in which TLS termination and
   certificate handling are performed by a fronting proxy, while the
   application itself remains unchanged and resides behind it.

6.  Need for Post-handshake Attestation

   We argue that post-handshake attestation is unavoidable (e.g., re-
   attestation to track changes after Connection Establishment Time for
   long-lived connections).  Use cases where pre-handshake attestation
   and intra-handshake attestation are insufficient include AI agents/
   agentic AI [I-D.jiang-seat-dynamic-attestation].

   Intra-handshake attestation only adds unnecessary complexity which is
   avoidable.  All identified use cases [I-D.mihalcea-seat-use-cases]
   where intra-handshake attestation seems suitable can be covered by
   post-handshake attestation (by doing attestation round immediately
   after Connection Establishment Time) but not the other way around.

6.1.  IoT Constraints

   [SEAT-Charter] includes TLS client as RATS Attester.  Client could be
   a low-power IoT device.  There are use cases where periodic or on-
   demand attestation is required, such as periodic attestation for
   long-lived, low-power IoT devices or in IoT swarms that need to
   synchronize software versions before coordinated operations or after
   configuration updates.

   Moreover, we note some observations from LAKE WG:

   Michael Richardson shares his insight [MCR-LAKE]:

   |  I have a half-written document on putting EAT into the full BRSKI
   |  protocol.  A reason that I stopped is that I realized that doing
   |  security posture evaluation at onboarding time (only) wasn't
   |  enough.  It has to be done regularly.  So having a protocol used
   |  at onboarding time and another one during normal operation meant
   |  that the onboarding one would have bugs that never get fixed,
   |  since the code only runs once.

   He further shares [MCR-LAKE2]:

   |  My contention, which I think the group agreed with, is that one
   |  probably wants to do continuous assurance, that is, to repeat the
   |  remote attestation.

   |  Do you want to have two protocols and two code paths? (redundant
   |  code in a constrained device?).  I suggested that _maybe_ the
   |  remote attestation should use it's own /.well-known Path, and that
   |  it would just occur after onboarding, and regularly onwards.
   |  Maybe it's weird to onboard a device only to kick it out again
   |  immediately because it failed remote attestation, but given
   |  continuous assurance, this could happen at any time.

   Göran Selander observes [Goran-LAKE]:

   |  Indeed, if the authentication procedure is repeated at a later
   |  stage, for whatever reason, e.g. key rotation, it should be
   |  possible to repeat the attestation procedure.

7.  Existing Implementations

7.1.  Intra-handshake Attestation

   Prominent implementations of intra-handshake attestation are all
   vulnerable to relay attacks [RelayAttacks].  Some of them are abusing
   the extensions of TLS, such as SNI and ALPN, for conveyance of
   attestation nonce [RelayAttacks].

7.2.  Post-handshake Attestation

   Google [Keith-STET-CCC], Microsoft [Stunes-vTPM-CCC], and SCONE
   [SoK-Attestation] are all using post-handshake attestation.

8.  Security Considerations

   Most of the document is about security considerations.  Also,
   Security Considerations of [RFC9334] and [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis]
   apply.  In addition:

   *  Pre-handshake attestation is vulnerable to *replay* [RA-TLS] and
      *diversion* [ID-Crisis] attacks.  Moreover, pre-handshake
      attestation leads to a single point of failure.

   *  Without significant changes to the TLS protocol: Intra-handshake
      attestation is vulnerable to *diversion* attacks [ID-Crisis].  We
      reported these attacks to TLS WG in February 2025
      [Usama-TLS-26Feb25].  A formal proof is available [ID-Crisis-Repo]
      for further research and development.  Since reporting to TLS WG,
      these attacks have been practically exploited in TEE.fail
      (https://tee.fail/), Wiretap.fail (https://wiretap.fail/), and
      BadRAM (https://badram.eu/).  More recently, we found that intra-
      handshake attestation also does not bind the Evidence to the
      application traffic secrets, resulting in *relay* attacks
      [RelayAttacks].  A detailed analysis of binding mechanisms is
      available at [RelayAttacks].

   *  No attacks on post-handshake attestation are currently known.
      Post-handshake attestation avoids replay attacks by using fresh
      attestation nonce.  Moreover, it avoids diversion and relay
      attacks by binding the Evidence to the underlying TLS connection,
      such as using Exported Keying Material (EKM)
      [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis], as proposed in Section 9.2 of
      [ID-Crisis].  [RFC9261] and [RFC9266] provide mechanisms for such
      bindings.  Efforts for a formal proof of security of post-
      handshake attestation are ongoing.

8.1.  Exploit of Sensitive Hardware-level Information

   From the view of the TLS server, post-handshake attestation offers
   better security than intra-handshake attestation when the server acts
   as the Attester.  In intra-handshake attestation, due to the inherent
   asymmetry of the TLS protocol, a malicious TLS client could
   potentially retrieve sensitive hardware-level information from the
   Evidence *without the client's trustworthiness (i.e., authentication)
   first being established by the server*. This information (e.g.,
   vulnerable firmware version) can be exploited for attacks.  In post-
   handshake attestation, the server can ask for client authentication
   and only send the Evidence after successful client authentication.
